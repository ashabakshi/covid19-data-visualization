# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Visualization using Python

This project explores and visualizes the global and regional spread of **COVID-19** using **Python** and **Matplotlib**.  
The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights through clean and powerful visualizations.

---

## 📊 Overview
- Analyzed COVID-19 case data (confirmed, recovered, and deaths)
- Country-wise and date-wise trends
- Visualized comparison between different countries
- Highlighted overall growth patterns and recovery rates

---

## 🧩 Libraries Used
- **NumPy** — numerical computations  
- **Pandas** — data cleaning and analysis  
- **Matplotlib** — data visualization  
- **Seaborn** — advanced and styled plots  

---

## 📈 Key Visuals
- Line chart showing rise in active cases over time  
- Bar plots comparing cases across countries  
- Pie chart representing global case distribution  
- Heatmaps for country-wise impact (optional if included)  

---

## 💡 Learnings
- Data cleaning and preprocessing with Pandas  
- Plot styling and customization using Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Understanding real-world data trends through visualization
